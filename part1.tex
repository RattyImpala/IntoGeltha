\section{Die roll convention.}
The game uses common six-sided dice, eight-sided dice, ten-sided dice and twelve sided dice. Each die you need to roll
is noted as ``d''. Unless otherwise noted otherwise, ``2d'', for example means \emph{roll two dice and add the result
together}. 

\section{The Basic Game Mechanic}

The basic game mechanic is the check. You throw 2d6, add the relevant skill and relevant modifier. A \emph{natural}
result of $\mathbf{2}$ is always a failure, regardless of skills and modifiers. A \emph{natural} result of $\mathbf{12}$ is always a success, even in adverse situations. 

\begin{longtable}{p{0.1\columnwidth}p{0.8\columnwidth}}
\hline
& \textbf{Skill Check Difficulties} \\
\hline
6 & A relatively simple task that is still more than the PC would usually be expected to manage in their regular background. Anything easier than this isn't worth a skill check. \\
8 & A significant challenge to a competent professional that they'd still succeed at more often than not. \\
10 & Something too difficult to be expected of anyone but a skilled expert, and even they might fail. \\
12 & Only a true master could expect to carry this off with any degree of reliability. \\
14+ & Only a true master could have any chance of achieving this at all, and even they will probably fail. \\

\section{Skills} 
Your hero's learned capabilities are skills, and every character has their share of them. Skills are measured in a rating from level-0 for competent practitioners and level-5 for one of the best in the world. Novice characters start with level-0 or level-1 in their skills.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Animals}: the care and training of animals. Also covers general agriculture.

\item \textbf{Admin}:  keep an organization running smoothly, scribe things well, plan out logistics, identify incompetent or treacherous workers, analyze records or archives, or otherwise do things that an executive or middle-manager would need to do.

\item \textbf{Connect}: find or know people who are useful to your purposes, make friendships or social acquaintances, know who to talk to get favors or services, and call on the help or resources of organizations you belong to. Connect covers your PC’s ability to find the people you need, though convincing them to help may require more than this.

\item \textbf{Craft}: the ability to maintain, repair, and build mechanical devices of all sorts, from crossbows to cartwheels. Also covers lockpicking.

\item \textbf{Exert}: the ability to exert oneself physically. You may add the Athletics skill to appropriate physical characterisc rolls. This skill is never rolled unskilled.

\item \textbf{Heal}: treat wounds, cure diseases, neutralize poisons, diagnose psychological health issues, and otherwise tend to the wounds of body and mind. The Heal skill cannot cure lost hit points directly, but it’s a vital skill in stabilizing Mortally Wounded allies or ensuring clean recovery from grievous injuries.

\item \textbf{Deception}: convincingly avoiding the truth and misleading other people.

\item \textbf{Investigation}: this skill combines keen observation, forensics, research, and detailed analysis.

\item \textbf{Know}: know matters of history, geography, natural science, zoology, and other academic fields appropriate to a sage or scholar. While some sages might specialize in particular fields, most learned men and women in this age have a broad range of understanding, and will rarely be unable to even attempt to answer a question relevant to this skill.

\item \textbf{Lead}: inspire others to follow your lead and believe in our plans and goals. Manage subordinates and keep them focused, loyal, and motivated in the face of danger or failure. A successful leader will keep their subordinate’s faith and confidence even when reason might make the leader’s plan appear questionable at best.

\item \textbf{Magic}: cast or analyze magic and know things about famous mages or notable magical events. Classes that can’t cast spells obtain only intellectual and scholarly benefits from this skill.

\item \textbf{Notice}: notice small details, impending ambushes, hidden features, or concealed objects. Detect subtle smells, sounds, or other sensory input. Notice cannot be used simply to detect a lie, but keen attention can often discern a subject’s emotional state.

\item \textbf{Liaison}: the art and practice of negotiation and diplomacy in a myriad of social situations. This skill covers diplomatic meetings, haggling with merchants, or diffusing a situation before blades start flashing.

\item \textbf{Perform}: sing, act, dance, orate, or otherwise perform impressively for an audience. Compose music, plays, writings, or other works of performance art. Most performers will have a particular field they excel at, though polymaths might exist if the PC’s background is appropriate for such versatility.

\item \textbf{Pray}: perform the clerical rites of your religion, and be familiar with the gods, demons, and taboos of major and minor faiths, and identify iconography and persons of religious importance. Pray also helps you know the state of local faiths and the important persons in their hierarchies.

\item \textbf{Punch}: fight unarmed or with natural body weaponry. Punch, kick, grapple, or otherwise brawl without the benefit of man-made tools.

\item \textbf{Recon}: scouting for danger and spotting threats.

\item \textbf{Ride}:  using animals for transportation, from riding a horse to driving a chariot to riding an elephant or dinosaur.

\item \textbf{Sail}:  controlling and using boats and ships, including navigation.

\item \textbf{Shoot}: use it as a combat skill when using ranged weaponry, whether thrown weapons, bows, pistols, combat rifles, or heavy artillery.

\item \textbf{Stab}:  fight with melee weapons or throw a hurled weapon. Maintain and identify weaponry.

\item \textbf{Sneak}: training in being unseen and unheard.

\item \textbf{Survive}: staying alive in the wilderness. This also covers \emph{outdoor} skills such as tracking, foraging, and fishing.

\item \textbf{Trade}:   Buy and sell at a profit, identify the worth of goods or treasures, deal with merchants and traders, find black-market goods and services, and know laws regarding smuggling and contraband.

\item \textbf{Work}: This skill is a catch-all for any profession that might not otherwise merit its own skill, such as a painter, lawyer, farmer, or herdsman. The precise skill it represents will vary with the PC’s background.
\end{itemize}

\section{Attribute scores}
Characteristics describe your character's general talents and abilities. They serve as basic skills for tasks which every character can perform better or worse than others.

Throw 3d6 and assign the results in order. You may then change one attribute of your choice to 14 if you wish to ensure that you character is gifted in at least one way.

\begin{description}
\item[STR (Strength)] Physical power and muscle. Governs lifting, breaking, melee combat, and feats of brute force.
\item[AGI (Agility)] Reflexes, and precision. Used for dodging, ranged attacks, acrobatics, and delicate tasks like picking locks.
\item[TGH (Toughness)] Endurance, physical resilience, and ability to withstand harm. Governs health, resistance to damage, and stamina.
\item[INT (Intelligence)] Knowledge, reasoning, and analytical skill. Governs learning, recall of information, and solving puzzles.
\item[WIL (Willpower)] Mental fortitude, determination, and force of personality. Governs magic, persuasion, resisting fear, and problem-solving.
\item[WIS (Wisdom)] Awareness, insight, and connection to the world. Used for spotting traps, sensing danger, and interpreting omens.

\section{Species} % (fold)
\label{sec:species}
In the world of Geltha, there are different species. Each one has a trait. Choose the species that suits you the most.

Human &   You are a Human, born into the diverse tapestry of Geltha's cultures. Your adaptable nature and drive for achievement make you equally at home in bustling cities or untamed wilderness. Whether seeking glory, justice, or enlightenment, your convictions fuel your journey and shape your destiny. Choose one of the following to gain as bonus skills: Connect, Notice, Shoot, Stab, Trade. As a human, luck can be on your side sometimes; as an Instant action, you can roll with advantage. Keep in mind that this stroke of luck can also go in the other direction. The DM can assign a malus to one of your subsequent rolls. \\ 
Dreathar & You are a Draethar, a resilient adventurer of Geltha’s sun-scorched plains. Your high-density muscles and extreme endurance make you a natural explorer, capable of traversing vast distances without rest. Whether tracking herds, foraging for resources, or venturing into uncharted lands, your adventurous spirit and physical prowess are unmatched. Choose one of the following to gain as a bonus skill: Survive, Exert, Notice, Ride, or Connect. You are physically tough; whenever you roll your hit
dice to determine your maximum hit points, the first
die you roll always counts as the maximum. Further
hit dice that roll a 1 are rerolled. \\ 
Athandarei & You are an Athandarei mutated to sense and reflect emotional energy. You have advantage on any check due to mind-affecting spells or abilities. Once per day, you can push yourself beyond your limits. For the rest of the scene, you gain a +2 bonus to any check made this way, but you must pay 1 HP for each check.\\

As such, choose one of the following to gain as a bonus skill: Know, Recon, Survive, Animal. Once per day, as an Instant action, you may consume the flesh of a humanoid to receive a +1 bonus for that day on a skill check where the humanoid was proficient. You can use this ability also to peek into its memories. \\
